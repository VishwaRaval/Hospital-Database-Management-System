# Hospital-Database-Management-System
During my undergraduate studies, in one of the courses, CSE250: Database Management System, I along with 2 other group members developed a system that can handle different workflows related to a hospital using MySQL and PHP. The main task is to develop a software that registers, stores, and meaningfully manipulates the information related to the patients, staff and doctors, appointments, visits, medicines, etc. (The detailed description about the project and its functionalities is mentioned in the report (Page2 - Page7).)
